# SideInstaller — build notes

Raw, full-featured on-device sideloader. Combines StikPair's RPPairing, a
LocalDevVPN-loopback lockdown connection, and SideStore's install/refresh model
into one app. The UI is a deliberately raw test harness (buttons + log console);
everything below the UI is the real pipeline.

## How to build

```sh
./build-rust.sh        # cross-compiles rust-core -> SideInstallerFFI.xcframework
xcodegen generate      # regenerates SideInstaller.xcodeproj from project.yml
# then open SideInstaller.xcodeproj, or:
xcodebuild build -project SideInstaller.xcodeproj -scheme SideInstaller \
  -sdk iphonesimulator -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17' \
  CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO
```

Toolchain used here: Xcode 27.0 beta (iOS 27.0 SDK), Rust 1.96 with targets
`aarch64-apple-ios` + `aarch64-apple-ios-sim`, xcodegen.

## Pins

| dependency | pin | features |
|---|---|---|
| idevice (jkcoxson) | rev `7bd551c16c6dd2e058740d85a2d9399a51a776e9` | `remote_pairing tunnel_tcp_stack rsd tcp xpc core_device_proxy installation_proxy installcoordination_proxy afc house_arrest misagent heartbeat mobile_image_mounter pair usbmuxd aws-lc` |
| idevice-ffi (vendored) | same rev, `vendor/idevice-ffi` | `full aws-lc` |
| isideload (nab138) | git `main` | `install fs-storage` (no keyring) |

The idevice rev matches StikPair's (RPPairing host) and StikDebug's
(`tunnel_create_rppairing` loopback connection), so both replicated mechanisms
track known-good implementations.

### Architecture decision: reuse idevice's own FFI for connection/install

Rather than re-implement idevice's threading-sensitive RSD tunnel + service
clients by hand (untestable here, high risk), `rust-core` depends on **both**:

- `idevice` (library) — for our forked RPPairing host (`pairing.rs`) and the
  logging spine.
- `idevice-ffi` (the crate StikDebug ships) — for the proven C-FFI
  (`tunnel_create_rppairing`, `installation_proxy_*`, `afc_*`, `lockdownd_*`,
  `rsd_*`, `rp_pairing_file_*`). `extern crate idevice_ffi as _;` re-exports its
  `#[no_mangle]` symbols into our single staticlib; cargo unifies the one
  `idevice` instance (no duplicate symbols — verified with `nm`).

idevice-ffi is **vendored** under `rust-core/vendor/idevice-ffi` with exactly
one change — `crate-type = ["rlib"]` (upstream is `staticlib+cdylib+rlib`;
rustc emits all in one pass and the standalone **cdylib** link fails on the iOS
*device* target). Swift gets both headers via the module map and calls idevice's
FFI directly from `DeviceConnection.swift`, exactly as StikDebug does.

The generated `idevice.h` (8948 lines, cbindgen, plist.h appended) is copied to
`rust-core/include/idevice.h`.

## Environment limits (important, honest)

The four make-or-break **runtime** steps cannot be tested in this build
environment — they need a physical iOS 17.4+ device with Developer Mode, the
LocalDevVPN app, and a real Apple ID. A simulator has none of that. So:

- Steps that are **device-independent** (FFI/log spine, IPA download, project
  build) are verified here.
- Steps that are **device-dependent** (RPPairing PIN, loopback connect,
  install, Apple ID sign-in) are written as real code but **unverified** until
  run on hardware. No fake success is stubbed anywhere.

## Progress (gate-by-gate)

### Step 1 — scaffold + logging spine ✅ (runtime-verified in simulator)

- `rust-core/` C-FFI crate: `si_log_init` installs a global `tracing`
  subscriber whose writer forwards every formatted line to a Swift callback;
  `si_ping` exercises `tracing::info!`.
- `build-rust.sh` + `project.yml` mirror StikPair; produce
  `SideInstallerFFI.xcframework` (ios-arm64 + ios-arm64-simulator).
- `ios-app/`: `Engine` (all logic, singleton so the C log callback can target
  it), raw `ContentView` (inputs / per-stage buttons / scrollable monospaced
  log console with Copy + Clear), `SideInstallerApp`.
- **Gate result:** built for the simulator and launched; the console shows Rust
  tracing output live, e.g.
  `[rust]  INFO sideinstaller_ffi: si_ping: Rust core alive (idevice @7bd551c linked)`.
  Transport/pairing-record types: N/A at this step.

### Step 2 — pairing + connection — code complete; device steps unverified

**Pairing (RPPairing host, make-or-break #1).** `pairing.rs` ports StikPair's
`run_host` (FFI `si_pairing_run_host`); `PairingController.swift` requests Local
Network, keeps the app alive with silent audio (works iOS 17.4+, vs StikPair's
iOS-26 `BGContinuedProcessingTask`), advertises over Bonjour via `NetService`,
runs the host off-thread, surfaces the PIN, and writes the pairing file to
`Application Support/rp_pairing_file.plist`. Reports every step into the log
console.

**LocalDevVPN's actual shape** (read from its source, `TunnelProv/PacketTunnelProvider.swift`):
`NEIPv4Settings(addresses: [TunnelDeviceIP])` puts **10.7.0.0** on the `utun`, with
`includedRoutes` = that subnet only and `excludedRoutes = [.default()]`. We connect to
the peer **10.7.0.1** (`TunnelFakeIP`), which is on no interface — the provider rewrites
`dst == fakeIP → deviceIP` inbound and `src == deviceIP → fakeIP` outbound. Three
consequences for us:

- The tunnel routes nothing off-device, so it needs **no Wi-Fi**. Only pairing does
  (Bonjour on the local network). `Engine.needsFreshPairing` is what gates the Wi-Fi
  requirement now.
- All three of tunnel IP, device IP and subnet mask are **user-editable** in LocalDevVPN,
  so `NetworkStatus` reads the interface's real netmask instead of assuming /24.
- Its config sets `isOnDemandEnabled = true` with `NEEvaluateConnectionRule(matchDomains:
  ["10.7.0.0", "10.7.0.1"])`, and never disables it. Those are **DNS domain** matches and
  we connect by raw IP, so they can never fire for our traffic — iOS is left free to tear
  the tunnel down whenever it likes. That is the mechanism behind the 0.6.5 "adapter
  closed (NetworkUnreachable)" failures. **Never trust `DeviceConnection.isConnected` to
  mean the tunnel is alive** — it only says our handles are non-null. Re-establish before
  any device work; a pair-verify is cheap and needs no PIN.

Since 0.7.0 the pairing file and isideload's `FsStorage` root both live in
Application Support rather than Documents — `UIFileSharingEnabled` exposes the
whole of Documents in Files (so an IPA can be dropped in), and that's no place
for a pairing record or a signing certificate. `PrivateStore` in
`SideStoreDownloader.swift` owns both paths and migrates 0.6.x's copies across
on first use, falling back to the Documents location if the move can't complete.

**Connection (loopback lockdown, make-or-break #2).** `DeviceConnection.swift`
drives idevice's FFI on the StikDebug recipe:
`rp_pairing_file_read` → `tunnel_create_rppairing(deviceIP:49152, pairing)` →
`(AdapterHandle, RsdHandshakeHandle)`; device info via
`lockdownd_connect_rsd` + `lockdownd_get_value(nil)` → plist
(ProductVersion/ProductType/UDID/…); apps via `installation_proxy_connect_rsd`
+ `installation_proxy_get_apps`. Default device IP `10.7.0.1` (LocalDevVPN
default), configurable in the UI.

**Transport used:** RPPairing pair-verify over the LocalDevVPN Wi-Fi loopback →
TLS-PSK tunnel → in-process software TCP stack (`tunnel_tcp_stack`) → RSD
handshake → services over RSD. Pairing-record type for **our own connection**:
**RPPairing** (`rp_pairing_file.plist`), not a classic lockdown record. The file
handed to *other* apps carries both records — see the format section under
step 4.

**Verified here (simulator):** project builds for device + sim; app launches;
network scan works; the idevice FFI is callable and errors surface raw —
a connect attempt with no pairing file returned
`idevice FFI error code=1 sub=0: NotFound` and was handled gracefully (no crash).

**NOT verifiable here (needs a physical iOS 17.4+ device + LocalDevVPN):** the
actual RPPairing PIN approval, the loopback tunnel, real device info, and the
app list. These are real code, unverified until run on hardware.

#### Connect transport — `Socket(ENOENT)` was NOT usbmuxd

On-device `Connect` failed instantly with
`Socket(Os { code: 2, NotFound, "No such file or directory" })`. ENOENT on a
socket op *looks* like a usbmuxd Unix-socket attempt — but there is **no
usbmuxd anywhere** in the connect path (`grep` confirms; the transport is
`tunnel_create_rppairing`, pure TCP). The real cause, from idevice's own
source: `IdeviceError::Socket(#[from] io::Error)` maps **every** `io::Error` to
the `Socket` variant, and `RpPairingFile::read_from_file` is just
`tokio::fs::read(path)`. So the ENOENT is `rp_pairing_file_read` failing because
`rp_pairing_file.plist` **didn't exist** — pairing never completed.

Fixes applied (connect path + pairing gate only):
- `Connect` now refuses to run unless the pairing file exists and is non-empty,
  with a clear message — never calls into idevice with a missing file.
- The RPPairing step logs explicit milestones (device connected on advertised
  port → PIN issued → handshake complete → **pairing file path + byte size**),
  and fails loudly if the written file is zero bytes.
- **Proven TCP, not usbmuxd:** with a valid pairing file, connecting to a dead
  `127.0.0.1:49152` returns `InternalError("connect: Connection refused (os
  error 61)")` — ECONNREFUSED, a real TCP error, **never ENOENT**. (Verified in
  the simulator via a temporary helper, since removed.)

### Step 3 — Apple ID + signing — code complete; device/account steps unverified

`account.rs` wraps isideload behind three FFI calls:
- `si_apple_signin` — `AppleAccount::builder().anisette_provider(RemoteV3…)
  .login(password, 2fa_cb)` → `DeveloperSession::from_account` →
  `SideloaderBuilder` (team `First`, `FsStorage`, machine name) → opaque
  `SignSession`. 2FA is bridged to a Swift prompt via a blocking semaphore
  callback (`SITwoFactorCb`).
- `si_sign_ipa(session, ipa, udid, device_name, …)` — first calls
  `DeveloperSession::ensure_device_registered(team, name, udid)` so the team has
  the connected device, then `Sideloader::sign_app(ipa, None, false)` → signed
  `.app` bundle path. sign_app internally registers the App ID + provisioning
  profile and retrieves/creates the dev certificate, then signs with
  `apple-codesign`. **Device registration is mandatory here:** we use the
  sign-only path (not isideload's `install_app`, which is the only place
  isideload registers the device), so without this step a fresh/free team has no
  devices and the profile download fails with developer error **8220** ("Your
  team has no devices …"). The UDID comes from the lockdown handshake, captured
  by Swift during Connect and passed down; a registration failure is prefixed
  `device registration failed for UDID <udid>:` so Swift can surface the UDID.
- `si_account_config(session, …)` — builds the `Account.sideconf` payload
  SideStore imports at launch: Apple ID, the signing certificate as a PKCS#12
  encrypted with its machine id (the convention AltStore-family apps expect),
  and the anisette identity. Swift writes it into SideStore's Documents in the
  same step as the pairing file (step 8), and SideStore's
  `LaunchViewController.detectAndImportAccountFile` adopts it and deletes it.

  **Why:** SideStore only signs with a certificate it holds the private key for.
  Ours never leaves this app, so its first sign-in revokes ours, mints its own,
  and shows "Resign SideStore". Nothing else fixes that. In particular isideload
  *already* injects `ALTCertificate.p12` + `ALTCertificateID` into the bundle
  (`application.rs::apply_special_app_behavior`) — recent SideStore reads
  neither for itself, so that path is inert here. `Account.sideconf` is the one
  hand-off it still honours automatically.

  Two **vendored additions** back this: `CertificateIdentity::retrieve_existing`
  (isideload's `retrieve` mints a certificate when it finds no match, which on a
  free account means revoking the one in use — reading the identity must never
  be able to do that, so this returns `None` instead), and `pub mod state` in
  `anisette::remote_v3`, so the stored `AnisetteState` can be read back.
  `anisetteIdentifier`/`anisetteAdiBlob` are base64 of `keychain_identifier` and
  `adi_pb` — exactly the encoding both sides already send the anisette server.
  The Apple ID password is omitted: it isn't needed to keep the certificate, and
  the file is plaintext JSON until SideStore consumes it.

  **Only builds that import it silently get the file.** SideStore's
  `ImportAccountAlertController` (2026-08-10) changed `detectAndImportAccountFile`:
  it now puts up an *Import Account* alert asking for a **file password**, accepts
  only the AES-GCM format `ImportExport.exportAccount` writes, never deletes the
  file, and records its checksum only once a decryption succeeds. Handing plaintext
  JSON to such a build means that alert on **every** launch, forever — it can never
  decrypt, so the checksum is never stored. iLoader shows no alert for the simple
  reason that it never writes the file (`install_sidestore_operation` places only
  `ALTPairingFile.mobiledevicepairing`), and step 8 now does the same when the
  hand-off can't land silently.

  `Engine.importsAccountConfigSilently()` decides, by scanning the SideStore
  binary in the signed bundle for `acctFileChecksum` — the `UserDefaults` key
  added in that same change, present as both a `#function` literal and an `@objc`
  accessor name. It is read off the binary rather than the version because the
  two don't track each other: LiveContainer's *stable* IPA bundles SideStore
  `0.6.4-20260714`, which still imports silently, while its nightly bundles
  `0.6.4-20260816`, which doesn't. Verified against all four shipping IPAs.
  Under LiveContainer the binary to read is the guest copy at
  `Frameworks/SideStoreApp.framework/SideStore`, where `build_github.sh` moves
  and dylibifies `SideStore.app`. When the check can't run, it errs towards not
  writing the file.

**idevice version coexistence:** isideload pulls idevice **0.1.61** (crates.io,
behind its `install` feature, which is required because its feature-gating is
incomplete) while the rest of the app uses idevice **0.1.63** (git). The two
versions coexist as distinct crates (different symbol hashes, no collision). We
only call the sign-only path, which takes no provider and never touches
idevice, so isideload's 0.1.61 install code is compiled-but-unused.

`SideStoreDownloader.swift` fetches the latest SideStore release IPA from the
GitHub API into `Documents/SideStore.ipa`.

**Verified here:** the account module compiles against isideload's API and the
whole tree cross-compiles for iOS; the SideStore download path is plain
URLSession (runs in the simulator).

**NOT verifiable here (needs a real Apple ID + 2FA + an Apple Developer
relationship):** the actual login, anisette handshake, cert/App ID/profile
creation, and signing. Real code, unverified until run with real credentials.

### Step 4 — install + finalize — code complete; device steps unverified

`DeviceConnection.swift` (idevice-ffi over the RSD tunnel from step 2):
- **Install:** `afc_client_connect_rsd` → recursively upload the signed `.app`
  bundle to `/PublicStaging/<name>.app` (afc_make_directory + chunked
  afc_file_write) → `installation_proxy_connect_rsd` →
  `installation_proxy_install_with_callback` (progress % streamed to the log).
- **Write pairing into SideStore:** `house_arrest_client_connect_rsd` →
  `house_arrest_vend_documents(bundleID)` → write the pairing file to
  `Documents/ALTPairingFile.mobiledevicepairing`. The bundle id is read from the
  signed bundle's Info.plist (isideload rewrites it to `<orig>.<teamID>`),
  falling back to `com.SideStore.SideStore`.

**Pairing-file format — resolved in 0.9.0 (was a documented caveat).** What the
RPPairing host produces is an **RPPairing** record (`public_key`,
`private_key`, `identifier`, `alt_irk`). That is all *our* tunnel needs, and all
StikDebug's sideloaded build reads — and nothing an AltStore-family app can
parse. SideStore hands its `ALTPairingFile.mobiledevicepairing` straight to
**minimuxer** (`AppBootManager.startMinimuxer`, via
`PairingFileManager.fetchPairingFile`), which wants a *classic* lockdown record:
`HostID`, `SystemBUID`, the host/root/device certificates and keys, `EscrowBag`,
`WiFiMACAddress`, `UDID`. Feather is the same.

iLoader ships **both records in one plist** (`pairing.rs::pairing_file` merges
`generate_lockdown_plist` with `generate_rppairing_plist`), and every reader
ignores the keys it doesn't know: idevice's `RpPairingFile::from_bytes` `remove`s
its four and drops the rest, and the classic side is a serde struct
(`RawPairingFile`) with no `deny_unknown_fields`.

We now build the same merged file, minting the missing half **on-device**:

- `DeviceConnection.lockdownPairRecord` runs the classic `Pair` handshake over
  the RSD tunnel that is already open — `lockdownd_connect_rsd` →
  `lockdownd_pair` → `idevice_pairing_file_serialize`. All of it is idevice-ffi
  that was already linked (`pair` is in our feature list); **no Rust change and
  no `build-rust.sh` run was needed**. idevice retries `Pair` internally on
  `PairingDialogResponsePending`, so the call blocks while the device shows its
  Trust prompt.
- Then `EnableWifiDebugging` in `com.apple.mobile.wireless_lockdown`, as iLoader
  does — without it lockdownd answers over USB only, and every app reading this
  record reaches it over a loopback. Tried **without** a session first: over USB
  (iLoader's route) `SetValue` in that domain needs `StartSession`, but over RSD
  the stream is already inside the RPPairing tunnel and the endpoint is the
  *trusted* one, while `StartSession` there would have to negotiate a second TLS
  session inside the first. A session attempt is the fallback.
- `CompositePairingFile` (in `PairingTargets.swift`) merges the two and stamps in
  the `UDID`, which the `Pair` response doesn't carry and minimuxer needs. Output
  is **XML, never binary**: SideStore reads the file with `String(contentsOf:)`
  and hands minimuxer the *string*.
- The classic half is cached (`Application Support/lockdown_pair_record.plist`,
  keyed on the device UDID) because minting it is interactive and spends a
  pairing slot; the merge itself is redone per write. A new RPPairing record
  invalidates the merged file but keeps the cached classic one.

Our lockdown half has the **same key set as iLoader's**: iLoader also
round-trips usbmuxd's record through `PairingFile::serialize()`, i.e. the same
`RawPairingFile` ten fields. Only the provenance differs — lockdown `Pair` over
RSD instead of a usbmuxd cache entry.

**Fallback, not a hard dependency:** if any of that fails, the write proceeds
with the RPPairing record alone — what shipped before — and says so in the log.

**Still unverified on hardware:** whether lockdownd accepts `Pair` on
`com.apple.mobile.lockdown.remote.trusted`, and which of the two
`EnableWifiDebugging` attempts lands. Both paths are logged explicitly.

**Transport used (whole pipeline):** the classic lockdown *transport* (usbmuxd,
port 62078) is **not** used — every device service (lockdown info,
installation_proxy, AFC, house_arrest) is reached over the in-process RSD tunnel
(`tunnel_create_rppairing` → software TCP stack → RSD handshake), authenticated
by the RPPairing record. The classic lockdown *protocol* is spoken over that same
tunnel for exactly one thing: minting the pair record other apps read
(`lockdownd_pair` on `com.apple.mobile.lockdown.remote.trusted`).

**Verified here:** full app builds for **both** the iOS *simulator* and a
*generic iOS device* (no undefined/duplicate symbols despite idevice 0.1.61 +
0.1.63 coexisting); launches; logging spine + ping + network scan + SideStore
download all run in the simulator.

**NOT verifiable here (needs a physical iOS 17.4+ device + LocalDevVPN + a real
Apple ID):** the AFC upload, installation_proxy install, and house_arrest write.
Real code, unverified until run on hardware.

#### Fix: house_arrest write double-free + write never committing

On-device, writing the pairing file crashed with `SIGABRT`
(`POINTER_BEING_FREED_WAS_NOT_ALLOCATED`) inside
`house_arrest_client_free`, and the file never landed. Root cause (confirmed in
idevice-ffi source): `house_arrest_vend_documents` does `Box::from_raw(client)`
— it **consumes** the HouseArrestClient (success *and* failure) and moves the
underlying `Idevice` into the returned AfcClient. The old code's
`defer { house_arrest_client_free(ha) }` then double-freed that `Idevice`. Fixes
(write path only):
- Never free the HouseArrestClient after vend (it's consumed); free only the
  AfcClient, once. `afc_file_close`/`afc_client_free` each consume their handle
  → called exactly once each.
- Check the `afc_file_close` error (AFC commits on close; the old defer ignored
  it — the silent-write bug).
- **Read-back verification:** re-open the path read-only and assert the byte
  length equals what was written (`afc_file_read_entire`); throw on mismatch.
  Returns the verified byte count, surfaced in the log.

#### Fix: house_arrest write `Afc(PermDenied)` — wrong AFC path

After the double-free fix, the install succeeded end-to-end (0→100%) but the
pairing write failed `Afc(PermDenied)` on the first `afc_file_open`. Cause:
idevice's `vend_documents` roots AFC at the app **container**, not at the
Documents dir, so writing bare `ALTPairingFile.mobiledevicepairing` targets the
(non-writable) container root. Fix (matches iLoader's `place_file`): write to
**`/Documents/ALTPairingFile.mobiledevicepairing`** (with the `/Documents/`
prefix), `mk_dir` the parent first, and open with `AfcWr`.

#### Fix: house_arrest `ApplicationLookupFailed` — wrong bundle id

In a session where the user hadn't just signed, `signedAppPath` was nil and the
code fell back to the hardcoded `com.SideStore.SideStore` — but isideload
installs the app as **`com.SideStore.SideStore.<teamID>`**, so `VendDocuments`
returned `ApplicationLookupFailed`. Fix: resolve the *installed* bundle id from
**installation_proxy** (`DeviceConnection.findInstalledBundleID(base:)` — exact
or `<base>.<teamID>` match), falling back to the signed bundle's id only if the
lookup finds nothing. The installation_proxy is the source of truth for what's
actually on the device.

## Running on a device (what you do)

1. Install LocalDevVPN (App Store id 6755608044), connect it, keep Wi-Fi on.
2. Build SideInstaller in Xcode (`./build-rust.sh && xcodegen generate`, then
   run on the device with your signing team).
3. In the app: type your Apple ID email + password and tap **Install
   SideStore**. The one-click flow runs every step in order — connect VPN →
   pair (it shows a PIN to enter + tells you where) → connect → Apple ID sign-in
   (enter the 2FA code when prompted) → download → sign → install → write
   pairing file — with a progress bar and a contextual instruction card at each
   gate. When it finishes, follow the final card to trust the cert
   (Settings › General › VPN & Device Management) and open SideStore.
4. If a step stops, the card shows a plain-English reason; open **Advanced** to
   run any step individually and **Copy** the raw log (idevice FFI codes +
   isideload `Report`s) for debugging.

### UI (friend-ready)

The raw test harness was replaced by a guided installer (`ContentView.swift`):
one primary **Install SideStore** button drives the whole `Engine.runOneClick()`
orchestrator; per-step buttons + the log console moved into a collapsible
**Advanced** section. The one-click path and the per-step buttons call the same
async step cores in `Engine`, so they can never drift. State for the progress
bar/checklist (`Engine.stepStates`, `installProgress`, `pairingPIN`, `guide`)
is all `@Published`. Reused-pairing/sign-in/download are skipped when already
valid; a stale pairing file triggers one automatic re-pair before giving up.

## Honest status summary

Everything below the UI is real, wired end-to-end, and compiles for device +
sim. The pieces that need a physical device, LocalDevVPN, or a real Apple ID
(RPPairing PIN, loopback tunnel, Apple ID login/2FA, cert/profile creation,
signing, install, house_arrest write) are written but **unverified** — they
cannot run in this environment. No step fakes success; failures surface raw
errors in the log.
